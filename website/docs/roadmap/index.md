# Radium Roadmap

Welcome to the Radium open-source roadmap. This document outlines our vision, technical architecture plans, protocol specifications, and governance model for building a composable intelligence infrastructure.

## Overview

Radium is evolving toward a comprehensive platform for self-assembling intelligence infrastructure. Our roadmap is organized into four key areas:

- **[Vision & Innovation](./vision.md)** - Long-term goals, core innovations, and architectural patterns
- **[Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md)** - Core systems, component patterns, and integration specifications
- **[Protocol Specifications](./protocol-specifications.md)** - KOR protocol, marketplace dynamics, and economic models
- **[Governance & Operations](./governance-operations.md)** - DAO structure, federation model, and tier operations

## High-Level Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Core agent orchestration system
- ✅ Multi-model support (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI)
- ✅ Policy engine and security framework
- ✅ Extension system
- 🚧 Component Foundry Pattern foundation
- 📋 Global Component Graph design

### Phase 2: Component Ecosystem
- 📋 Component Foundry implementation
- 📋 Component marketplace infrastructure
- 📋 Durable Autonomous Continuous Remediation (DACR)
- 📋 Agentic component integration

### Phase 3: Protocol & Marketplace
- 📋 KOR protocol specification implementation
- 📋 Marketplace dynamics and economics
- 📋 Federation structure
- 📋 Commons tier operations

### Phase 4: Governance & Scale
- 🔮 DAO structure and governance
- 🔮 Phase evolution system
- 🔮 Enterprise financial models
- 🔮 Global component graph deployment

## Progress Tracking

### Overall Progress

| Category | Status | Progress |

- **2025-01-XX**: Vision document extracted from OpenKor whitepapers
- **2025-01-XX**: Technical architecture roadmap established

## Key Innovations

Radium incorporates several patent-worthy innovations:

1. **Component Foundry Pattern (CFP)** - Systematic approach to creating, validating, and composing reusable AI components
2. **Durable Autonomous Continuous Remediation (DACR)** - Self-healing systems that maintain component quality over time
3. **Durable Recursive Component Generation (DRCG)** - Components that generate other components recursively
4. **Autonomous Component-Centric Assembly (ACCA)** - Self-assembling systems that compose themselves from available components

See the [Vision & Innovation](./vision.md) document for detailed descriptions.
