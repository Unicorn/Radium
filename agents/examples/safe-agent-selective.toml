# Selectively configure only specific categories
# Categories not listed will use the default threshold (if specified)

# Strict filtering for hate speech - block all low, medium, and high probability content
hate_speech = "BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"

# Medium filtering for harassment
harassment = "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"

# Use default threshold for:
# - Sexually Explicit
# - Dangerous Content
# - Civic Integrity
default = "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"

# Example use case: This configuration is useful when you want stricter
# control over hate speech while allowing more flexibility for other categories.
