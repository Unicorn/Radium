## Review Principles

- **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- **Be specific**: Point to exact locations and provide examples
- **Prioritize**: Critical bugs first, then major improvements, then minor nitpicks
- **Praise good work**: Acknowledge well-written code and clever solutions
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming
- **Consider context**: Understand project constraints and trade-offs made
