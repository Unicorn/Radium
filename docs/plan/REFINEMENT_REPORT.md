# REQ Documents Refinement Report

**Date**: 2025-12-06  
**Status**: Complete  
**Based on**: Validation Report from Task 6

## Executive Summary

The validation report identified **no critical or high-priority issues**. All REQ documents meet quality standards and are Braingrid-compatible. Only minor low-priority observations were noted, which are acceptable as-is. No fixes were required.

## Issues Reviewed

### Critical Issues

**None** ✅

### High Priority Issues

**None** ✅

### Medium Priority Issues

**None** ✅

### Low Priority Issues

1. **REQ-010 (Policy Engine) and REQ-012 (Custom Commands)**: Already implemented but listed as separate REQs from parent features
   - **Decision**: Keep as-is
   - **Rationale**: Separate REQs provide better clarity and independent value. Both REQs accurately document their features.

2. **Some REQs have "TBD" for estimated effort**:
   - REQ-009 (MCP Integration): 4-5h (from source docs)
   - REQ-011 (Context Files): 3-4h (from source docs)
   - REQ-018 (Extension System): TBD (future feature)
   - REQ-019 (Hooks System): TBD (future feature)
   - **Decision**: Acceptable for planned features
   - **Rationale**: Effort estimates can be refined when implementation begins. Source documents provide estimates where available.

## Changes Made

### No Changes Required

All REQ documents are complete, consistent, and meet quality standards. No fixes were applied.

## Re-Validation Results

### Structure Validation

✅ **All REQs maintain template structure** - No changes made

### Content Quality
