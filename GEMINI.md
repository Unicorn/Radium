# Gemini Development Instructions

This file references the shared agent instructions for Gemini-based agents.

## Source of Truth

All development instructions are maintained in: `docs/development/agent-instructions.md`

Please refer to that file for:
- Braingrid integration guidelines
- REQ-XXX and task management
- Git workflow and commit standards
- Testing requirements
- Development cycle best practices

## Quick Start

When a user references REQ-XXX:
1. Check Braingrid for the requirement and tasks
2. Ensure tasks are well-defined (break down if needed)
3. Set REQ status to IN_PROGRESS
4. Update task status in real-time as you work
5. Mark REQ as REVIEW when complete and tests pass

See `docs/development/agent-instructions.md` for complete instructions.
