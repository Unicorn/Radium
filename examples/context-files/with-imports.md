# Project Context

This example demonstrates organizing context across multiple files using imports.

## Imported Context

The following files are imported to provide comprehensive project guidelines:

@coding-standards.md
@architecture-notes.md

## Project-Specific Instructions

This is the main project context file. It imports standards and architecture notes from other files, then adds project-specific instructions below.

### Project Goals

- Build a high-performance agent orchestration platform
- Maintain excellent code quality and test coverage
- Provide clear documentation for all features
- Support multiple AI providers seamlessly

### Team Guidelines

- All code changes require code review
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD when possible)
- Update documentation with every feature addition
- Keep commits focused and well-documented

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Update documentation
4. Submit pull request for review
5. Merge after approval and CI passes
