# Cursor Rules for Radium Development

These rules reference the shared agent instructions. See `docs/development/agent-instructions.md` for complete guidelines.

## Core Instructions

Follow all guidelines in `docs/development/agent-instructions.md`, especially:

- Braingrid integration and REQ-XXX handling
- Task status updates in real-time
- Git commit message format: `[REQ-XXX] [TASK-X] Description`
- Testing requirements for all features
- Status workflow: IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → REVIEW

## Quick Reference

When working on REQ-XXX:
1. Check Braingrid: `braingrid requirement show REQ-XXX -p PROJ-14`
2. Ensure tasks exist and are well-defined
3. Set REQ status to IN_PROGRESS when starting
4. Update task status as you work
5. Mark REQ as REVIEW when all tasks complete and tests pass
